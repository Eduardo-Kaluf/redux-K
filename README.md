# EGG, a generic processor emulator

EGG stands for "Emulador Genérico do Gabriel" ("Gabriel's Generic Emulator", in
portuguese). It's a modular emulator for processor architetures, made for
educational purpouses.

Currently, the emulator is in a state I like, I just have to document
everything, setup the GitHub Actions and all the burocracy (issues, pr, etc) so
I make a release.
